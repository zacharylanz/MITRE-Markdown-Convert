**Description**: [CURIUM](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1012) is an Iranian threat group first reported in November 2021 that has invested in building a relationship with potential targets via social media over a period of months to establish trust and confidence before sending malware. Security researchers note [CURIUM](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1012) has demonstrated great patience and persistence by chatting with potential targets daily and sending benign files to help lower their security consciousness.(Citation: Microsoft Iranian Threat Actor Trends November 2021)
