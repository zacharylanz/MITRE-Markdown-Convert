**ID**: intrusion-set--c5574ca0-d5a4-490a-b207-e4658e5fd1d7
**Description**: [Scarlet Mimic](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0029) is a threat group that has targeted minority rights activists. This group has not been directly linked to a government source, but the group's motivations appear to overlap with those of the Chinese government. While there is some overlap between IP addresses used by [Scarlet Mimic](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0029) and [Putter Panda](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0024), it has not been concluded that the groups are the same.
