**ID**: campaign--808d6b30-df4e-4341-8248-724da4bac650
**Description**: The [SolarWinds Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0024) was a sophisticated supply chain cyber operation conducted by [APT29](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016) that was discovered in mid-December 2020. [APT29](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016) used customized malware to inject malicious code into the SolarWinds Orion software build process that was later distributed through a normal software update; they also used password spraying, token theft, API abuse, spear phishing, and other supply chain attacks to compromise user accounts and leverage their associated access. Victims of this campaign included government, consulting, technology, telecom, and other organizations in North America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Industry reporting initially referred to the actors involved in this campaign as UNC2452, NOBELIUM, StellarParticle, Dark Halo, and SolarStorm.(Citation: SolarWinds Advisory Dec 2020)(Citation: SolarWinds Sunburst Sunspot Update January 2021)(Citation: FireEye SUNBURST Backdoor December 2020)(Citation: Volexity SolarWinds)(Citation: CrowdStrike StellarParticle January 2022)(Citation: Unit 42 SolarStorm December 2020)(Citation: Microsoft Analyzing Solorigate Dec 2020)(Citation: Microsoft Internal Solorigate Investigation Blog)
